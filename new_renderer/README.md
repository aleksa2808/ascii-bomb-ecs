# ascii-bomb-ecs

Port of the [ascii-bomb](https://github.com/aleksa2808/ascii-bomb) game in Rust.

I ditched the curses-like libraries and instead went with the [Bevy engine](https://bevyengine.org). This proved handy for learning about the ECS paradigm, but it also made a [web build](https://aleksa2808.github.io/ascii-bomb-ecs/) possible!
